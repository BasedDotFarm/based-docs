**bBOND isn't just a token – it's a counterbalance:**

- **Deflationary Mechanism**: When BASED's TWAP falls below Ethereum, users can purchase bBOND with BASED, burning BASED to reduce its supply.

- **Incentive to Hold**: Having bBOND becomes advantageous when BASED is above its peg, the reward for redemption increases as the peg does.

## The Value of bBOND

1. **Equilibrium Maintenance**: It acts as a buffer, absorbing excess BASED during price dips and releasing BASED during price surges.
  
2. **Engagement Catalyst**: bBOND drives user participation, rewarding those who interact with the protocol during both its highs and lows.
