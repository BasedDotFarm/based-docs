## Tax Mechanism

The Warden Tax system is a safeguard to help the protocol's growth. **It is dynamic and adjusts based on the BASED peg to Ethereum.** As BASED peg fluctuates, so does the tax rate â€“ a mechanism we've implemented to help the maintain price closer to peg. It will not be implemented until bBONDS are and is flexible enough to be updated with governance.

**The Warden Tax system will be applied to SWAPS! Creating LPs will not be taxed!** The graph and table below provides a clear breakdown of the tax rates at various BASED peg levels:

**Always be mindful of the current BASED peg before executing transactions, as it directly influences the slippage you'll encounter.**
