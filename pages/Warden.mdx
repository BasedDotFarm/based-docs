## Tax Mechanism

The Warden Tax system is a safeguard to help the protocol's growth. It is dynamic and adjusts based on the **BASED** peg to ETH. As **BASED** peg fluctuates, so does the tax rate – a mechanism we've implemented to help the maintain price closer to peg. It will not be implemented until **bBONDS** are and is flexible enough to be updated with governance.

The Warden Tax system will be applied to SWAPS! Creating LPs will not be taxed! The graph and table below provides a clear breakdown of the tax rates at various **BASED** peg levels:

Always be mindful of the current **BASED** peg before executing transactions, as it directly influences the slippage you'll encounter.
