Welcome to **The Forge** - the core inflation mechanism of Based.Farm. This is where BASED tokens are minted.

### How It Works

1. **Staking**: Users can stake their bSHARE in The Forge.
2. **Minting**: When BASED's value rises above Ethereum, The Forge mints new tokens.
3. **Rewards**: The newly minted BASED tokens are then distributed to stakers based on their bSHARE contribution.

### Key Parameters:

- **Epoch Duration**: 6 hours.
- **Deposits/Withdrawals**: Depositing or withdrawing bSHARE into/from the Forge will lock bSHARE for 6 epochs and BASED rewards for 3 epochs.
- **Reward Claims**: Claiming BASED rewards will lock staked bSHARE for 6 epochs, and the subsequent BASED rewards can only be claimed 3 epochs later.

## Getting Started

**Before staking in The Forge, it's vital to understand that deposits and withdrawals will lock bSHARE and BASED rewards for three epochs.**

To start using The Forge:

1. Navigate to The Forge on Based.Farm.
2. Connect your wallet.
3. Choose the amount of bSHARE you wish to stake.
4. Confirm the transaction.
