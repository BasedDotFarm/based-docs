Welcome to **The Forge** - the core inflation mechanism of **Based.Farm**. This is where **BASED** tokens are minted.

### How It Works

1. **Staking**: Users can stake their **bSHARE** in The Forge.
2. **Minting**: When **BASED**'s value rises above its ETH peg, The Forge mints new tokens.
3. **Rewards**: The newly minted **BASED** tokens are then distributed to stakers based on their **bSHARE** contribution.

### Key Parameters:

- **Epoch Duration**: 6 hours.
- **Deposits/Withdrawals**: Depositing or withdrawing **bSHARE** into/from Masonry will lock **bSHARE** for 6 epochs and **BASED** rewards for 3 epochs.
- **Reward Claims**: Claiming **BASED** rewards will lock staked **bSHARE** for 6 epochs, and the subsequent **BASED** rewards can only be claimed 3 epochs later.

## Getting Started ðŸ”¨

Before staking in The Forge, it's vital to understand that deposits and withdrawals will lock **bSHARE** and **BASED** rewards for three epochs.

To start using **The Forge**:

1. Navigate to The Forge on **Based.Farm**.
2. Connect your wallet.
3. Choose the amount of **bSHARE** you wish to stake.
