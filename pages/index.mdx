Welcome to Based.Farm, the first Solidly powered Seigniorage Protocol!

**Seigniorage will be the engine that scales Ethereum liquidity on Base Chain.** Traditionally based on monetary supply, seigniorage controls token value with measured inflation and deflation. Based.Farm improves this and liquidity conditions on Base Chain, while also maximizing efficiency using Solidly ([**AerodromeFi**](https://aerodrome.finance/)).

- [**BASED**](http://docs.based.farm/BASED) - Pegged 1:1 with Ethereum.
- [**bSHARE**](http://docs.based.farm/bSHARE) - Rewarded newly emitted BASED for staking.
- [**bBOND**](http://docs.based.farm/bBOND) - Burns excess BASED for stability.

## The Mechanism of SEIGNIORAGE

**When BASED rises above Ethereum, new tokens are minted,** rewarding those with bSHARE staked. This naturally increases the supply, nudging the token's value closer to its peg. **On the flip side, should BASED drop below its peg, minting halts,** creating a deflationary phase. During this phase, holders can opt to trade BASED for bBOND, effectively decreasing the total supply and gradually elevating the price.

---------------------


At Based.Farm, every piece of the puzzle is meticulously designed to ensure the harmonious flow of BASED. The inflation and deflation described above is controlled by [**The Forge**](http://docs.based.farm/Forge), [**The Warden**](http://docs.based.farm/Warden), and [**Bonds**](http://docs.based.farm/Bonds). **These mechanisms dynamically adjust BASED supply, pushing price up or down relative to Ethereum.** 

- [**The Armory**](http://docs.based.farm/Armory) - Liquidity ensures protocol health and longevity.
- [**The Forge**](http://docs.based.farm/Forge) - Controls BASED inflation during periods of high-demand.
- [**The Warden**](http://docs.based.farm/Warden) - Stabilizes price during volatility.
- [**Bonds**](http://docs.based.farm/Bonds) - Burns BASED supply.

## sAMM Advantage

This graph depicts the swap curves of stable (blue) and volatile (red) automated market markers, **the flatter the curve, the lower the slippage.** For asset pools pegged _1:1_, stable AMMs are more reliable.

**Seigniorage protocols have a singular mission - keeping their main asset pegged to its target value.** With BASED being pegged _1:1_ with Ethereum, [**AerodromeFi**](https://aerodrome.finance/) sAMM pools are a no-brainer. Traditional AMMs can intensify volatility; sAMM increases depth (amount you can buy), allowing consistent outputs. This creates minimal slippage, allowing even large trades to maintain liquidity equilibrium. For asset pools like BASED/ETH, this is key. Without getting too deep into the formulas, sAMM keeps total pool liquidity consistent, regardless of trade volume and market fluctuation.

The essence of Based.Farm lies in individual choices, with inflation and deflation built on emissions, voting gauges, and bribes. **With incentives strategically placed, each participant has the freedom to optimize their yield, providing opportunities in every scenario.**

Your strategy is your strength. Finding the right mix between [**BASED**](http://docs.based.farm/BASED), [**bSHARE**](http://docs.based.farm/bSHARE), and [**bBOND**](http://docs.based.farm/bBOND) is the key to maximizing your time at Based.Farm.
