Welcome to **Based.Farm**, the first Solidly powered Seigniorage Protocol!

Seigniorage is the engine that powers **Based.Farm**. Traditionally based on monetary supply, in our case, it's the mechanism controlling token value with controlled inflation and deflation. While Tomb Finance showcased the potential of this mechanism, we've taken it a step further by adapting the protocol to effectively maximize Solidly dexes ([**AerodromeFi**](https://twitter.com/aerodromefi)).

- [**BASED**](http://docs.based.farm/BASED) - Pegged 1:1 with ETH.
- [**bSHARE**](http://docs.based.farm/bSHARE) - Receives newly emitted **BASED** as a reward.
- [**bBOND**](http://docs.based.farm/bBOND) - Burns excess **BASED** for stability.

## The Mechanism of SEIGNIORAGE ⚙️

When **BASED** rises above its ETH peg, new tokens are minted, rewarding those with **bSHARE** staked. This naturally increases the supply, nudging the token's value closer to its peg. On the flip side, should **BASED** drop below its peg, minting halts, creating a deflationary phase. During this phase, holders can opt to trade **BASED** for **bBOND**, effectively decreasing the total supply and gradually elevating the price.

At Based.Farm, every piece of the puzzle is meticulously designed to ensure the harmonious flow of **BASED**. The inflation and deflation described above is controlled by [**The Forge**](http://docs.based.farm/Forge), [**The Warden**](http://docs.based.farm/Warden), and [**Bonds**](http://docs.based.farm/Bonds). These mechanisms dynamically adjust **BASED** supply, pushing price up or down relative to **Ethereum**. 

- [**The Armory**](http://docs.based.farm/Armory) - Liquidity ensures protocol health and longevity.
- [**The Forge**](http://docs.based.farm/Forge) - Controls **BASED** inflation during periods of high-demand.
- [**The Warden**](http://docs.based.farm/Warden) - Stabilizes price during volatility.
- [**Bonds**](http://docs.based.farm/Bonds) - Burns **BASED** supply.

## sAMM Advantage ✅

This graph depicts the swap curves of **stable** (blue) and **volatile** (red) automated market markers, the flatter the curve, the lower the slippage. For asset pools pegged _1:1_, **stable AMMs** are more reliable.

Seigniorage protocols have a singular mission - keeping their main asset pegged to its target value. With **BASED** being pegged _1:1_ with ETH, [**AerodromeFi**](https://twitter.com/aerodromefi) **sAMM** pools are a no-brainer. Traditional **AMMs** can intensify stablecoin volatility; **sAMM** increases depth (amount you can buy), allowing consistent outputs. This creates minimal slippage, allowing even large trades to maintain liquidity equilibrium. For asset pools like **BASED/ETH**, this is key. Without getting too deep into the formulas, **sAMM** keeps total pool liquidity consistent, regardless of trade volumes or market fluctuations.

-------------------------------

The essence of **Based.Farm** lies in individual choices. While protocols like Tomb Finance have set algorithms, **BASED** inflation and deflation pivot on individual market decisions while considering voting gauges and bribes. With incentives strategically placed, each participant has the freedom to optimize their yield, providing opportunities in every scenario.

Your strategy is your strength. Finding the right mix between [**BASED**](http://docs.based.farm/BASED), [**bSHARE**](http://docs.based.farm/bSHARE), and [**bBOND**](http://docs.based.farm/bBOND) is the key to maximizing your time at Based.Farm.
