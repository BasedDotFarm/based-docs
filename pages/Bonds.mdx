Bonds are the mechanism used to return BASED to peg when it deviates below Ethereum.

## Overview

bBOND tokens activate when BASED deviates from its peg. Here's how it functions:


- **Purchase Conditions**: Available when BASED is below Ethereum.
- **TWAP Constraint**: No issuance if BASED's TWAP is between 1.00 and 1.01 ETH.
- **Redemption**: Available for redemption when BASED rises above the Ethereum.
    - For example, if BASED's TWAP is less than 1, exchanging BASED for bBOND will occur at a _1:1_ ratio.

As BASED rises above its peg, the redemption value of bBOND becomes more lucrative to incentivize users to exchange their bBOND for BASED.

## Redemption Ratio

 The bBOND to BASED ratio will be 1:R, with R being determined with the formula below.

**Δ** = BASED TWAP Price, 
**β** = Coefficient of 0.7

## bBOND Zapper 

When BASED is trading over peg, users can utilize the Zapper to transition from bBOND to bSHARE in a simplified process:

## Why Engage with bBOND?

- **Stabilizing the Ecosystem**: By purchasing bBOND during downturns, you help stabilize the BASED price and ensure its peg to Ethereum.
  
- **Profit Opportunities**: The structured redemption mechanism means that proactive users can benefit from price fluctuations.

- **Supporting the Protocol**: Engaging with bBOND means you're actively participating in the protocol's stability mechanism, fostering a more resilient ecosystem.

**Remember, as with all crypto assets and mechanisms, there's a level of risk associated with buying and redeeming bonds. Always ensure you're well-informed before making any decisions.**
