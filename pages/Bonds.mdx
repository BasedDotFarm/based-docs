Bonds are the mechanism used to return **BASED** to peg when it deviates below 1 **ETH**.

## Overview

**bBOND** tokens activate when **BASED** deviates from its peg. Here's how it functions:


- **Purchase Conditions**: Available when **BASED** is below its 1 ETH peg.
- **TWAP Constraint**: No issuance if **BASED**'s TWAP is between 1.00 and 1.01 ETH.
- **Redemption**: Available for redemption when **BASED** rises above the 1 ETH peg.
    - For example, if **BASED**'s TWAP is less than 1, exchanging **BASED** for **bBOND** will occur at a 1:1 ratio.

As **BASED** rises above its peg, the redemption value of **bBOND** becomes more lucrative to incentivize users to exchange their **bBOND** for **BASED**.

## Redemption Ratio ➕➖✖️

 The **bBOND** to **BASED** ratio will be 1:R, with R being determined with the formula below.
